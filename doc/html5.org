#+TITLE: FTW! HTML5

We want HTML5. We want sexp html5. We deserve a gerbil html5!

* Usage 

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
> (shtml5-page->string '(ul (li "asd") (hr)))
;; => 
"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<ul><li>asd</li><hr></ul>"
#+END_SRC

* SHTML5: SXML + HTML5 = happy!

Sexps are divine, and *[[http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/SXML.html][SXML]]* unites a markup language with
S-expressions. All that's needed is a tiny shim.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle "../gerbil/shtml5.ss"
  ;;; -*- Gerbil -*-
  (export shtml5-page->string shtml5->string)
  (import :std/xml
    (only-in :gerbil/gambit/ports write-string))

  (def html5-doctype "<!DOCTYPE html>")

  (def (shtml5-page->string shtml5 doctype: (doctype html5-doctype))
    (call-with-output-string
      (or doctype "")
      (lambda (p)
	(when doctype (write-string "\n" p))
	(print-sxml->html-fast
	 (list '*TOP* shtml5) p))))

  (def (shtml5->string shtml5)
    (shtml5-page->string shtml5 doctype: #f))
#+END_SRC
